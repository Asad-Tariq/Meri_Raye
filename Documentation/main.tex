\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
\justify
For our application, \textbf{Meri Raye}, we will have the following \textbf{non-functional requirements}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Performance:
                    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
                        \item The start-up time of the application should not be greater than approximately $10$ seconds.
                        \item The average response time of each feature of the application should also be approximately $10$ seconds (depending on which feature is being used).
                    \end{enumerate}
    \item Security:
                    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
                        \item The data in our database (MongoDB) should be secured with TLS/SSL encryption.
                        \item While logging in, the passwords in the password field of the login page should be hidden (most commonly achieved using asterisks).
                        \item After a certain number of incorrect attempts (5) to log in the application, the user's account will be locked for a short time period (5 minutes).
                    \end{enumerate}
    \item Reliability:
                    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
                        \item The application will need a stable internet connection (WiFi or 3g/4g) in order to view and post recommendations (which might or might not include pictures and videos).
                    \end{enumerate}
    \item Maintainability:
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item The development team will ensure software modularity and follow the principles of clean coding to make the software as maintainable as possible.
                    \end{enumerate}
    \item Accessibility:
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item Our application will be compatible with Android 7.0 and above so that it is accessible to as many users as possible including those who may not have access to newer smartphones.
                    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
